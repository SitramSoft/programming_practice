# **Repository used for tracking my journey in learning Python programming language**

## **Progress**

### 13.10.2020

* Reworked the existing python files because they were not compiling with with python 3
* Practiced a bit Markdown syntax by reworking the README.md file in the repository in order to keep a status of activities done. This way it's easier to remember where I left in case I need to take a break and resume this activity later on. Found a great [reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) online for quickly checking different syntax elements
* Started going trough [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python chapter 8](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/)

### 14.10.2020

* Continue going trough [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python chapter 8](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/)

### 19.10.2020

* Found a new repo on GitHub name [Practical Python](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python/blob/master/Notes/Contents.md) which seems to be worth going trough since it offers a more compact organization of information. Decided to set on hold the current course and continue with this one.
* Organized the files in the repo based on the different course or library that I study. So far all the scripts are split into 3 categories:
    * [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://github.com/SitramSoft/pythonLearning/tree/master/Automate%20the%20Boring%20Stuff%20with%20Python) - contains scripts created while going trough the [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/) course
    * [Others](https://github.com/SitramSoft/pythonLearning/tree/master/Other) - contains misc scripts from unknown courses
    * [PyGame](https://github.com/SitramSoft/pythonLearning/tree/master/PyGame) - contains  scripts used for learning the [PyGame library](https://www.pygame.org/news)
    * Practical Python Programming - contains scripts created while going trough the [Practical Python Programming](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python) course from GitHub
