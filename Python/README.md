# **Repository used for tracking my journey in learning Python programming language**

## **Progress**

### 13.10.2020

* Reworked the existing python files because they were not compiling with with python 3
* Practiced a bit Markdown syntax by reworking the README.md file in the repository in order to keep a status of activities done. This way it's easier to remember where I left in case I need to take a break and resume this activity later on. Found a great [reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) online for quickly checking different syntax elements
* Started going trough [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python chapter 8](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/)
